Develop a Streamlit web application that converts text inputs, either entered manually or uploaded via a file, into spoken audio using the gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library.
- **Features:**
  - **Text Input Field:** Allows users to enter text directly into the application.
  - **File Upload:** Users can upload a text file, and the application will read and convert its content to speech.
  - **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Utilizes gTTS to convert text to speech.
  - **Audio Playback:** Uses Streamlit's audio playback features to allow users to listen to the generated speech.
  - **Warnings:** Alerts users if there is no text to convert.
- **Key Components and Libraries:**
  - **Streamlit:** For building the web application interface.
  - **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech):** For converting text to audio.
  - **BytesIO:** For handling in-memory byte streams.
  - **os:** For interacting with the operating system, if necessary.
    
**The main purpose of a Text2Talk Converting Application is to transform written text into spoken words.
Hereâ€™s how it can be incredibly useful in real-time applications:**

1. **Accessibility:**
